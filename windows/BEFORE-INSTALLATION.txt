DO THIS BEFORE RUNNING INSTALL.BAT

1) Download and install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2. If you already have it, skip this step.

All .NET 4.X Framework versions:

ABOUT INSTALL.BAT

- Automatically compiles OpenRA with Tiberian Sun & Red Alert 2 from the source for you
- This is the file you need to execute if you're looking for installation of OpenRA with Tiberian Sun & Red Alert 2
- Double click to execute it

------------------------------------------------

- Once the install.bat script has compiled the game, there should be many warnings but not a single error 
message as output. I got 52 errors if I had only .NET Framework 4.5 installed. 

- I got only 13 warnings after I installed Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4 
(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279)

- However, the number of those warning messages didn't affect my gameplay in any way. That's why I'm not sure 
if you need to worry about them. I can't really recommend to install 1.7GB of unneeded stuff on your PC
without a very good and valid reason.

- If you feel it important or your game crashes etc., please consider installing that SDK stuff and 
re-running the install.bat the game.
